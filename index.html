            <p>My name is Cameron Hurley. I graduated from Plymouth State University in 2011 with a Bachelors Degree in Marketing.
                After graduating I moved down to Boston for 4 years where I worked in various restaurant, retail, and managerial
                roles. I moved back to my homestate of NH in 2015 where I continued to work in sales. I have always been
                intruiged by the Technology field and coding in general, prompting me to enroll into a coding bootcamp to
                pursue a career in Web/Software Development.</p>

            <p>I am an avid fisherman of Striped Bass and try to get out on the water in any free time I have. I also am a huge
                Boston sports fan with football being my favorite. I also enjoy going to the beach, hiking, travelling to
                new places, and hanging out with friends.</p>
